"""System Architecture"""

* The data of a Linux system is distributed according to a tree structure. 
* Thus, if a folder folder1 contains two subfolders subfolder1 and subfolder2, 
the structure of these folders can be represented as follows:

folder1

- subfolder1
- subfolder2


And if the subfolder1 folder contains the files file1 and file2, the structure becomes:

folder1

- subfolder1
- - file1
- - file2
- subfolder2

in particular, the system architecture starts at the root designated by the symbol ( / ).

In this directory, we find the following subdirectories:

/bin: contains the essential binary files (Bash shell, files manipulation, ...);

/boot: contains the files needed to start the system;

/cdrom: temporary directory used for CD-ROMs;

/dev: contains special files for some tools (console, stdout, ...);

/etc: contains system configuration files;

/home: contains user data files;

/lib: contains the libraries needed to run the binary files contained in /bin and /sbin;

/lost+found: contains files corrupted after a system crash;

/media: contains the location of temporary external folders (USB key, ...);

/mnt: contains mounted directories;

/opt: contains some files that do not respect the classic file hierarchy;

/proc: contains system information;

/root: home folder for the root user;

/run: contains temporary files used by programs that should NOT be deleted;

/sbin: contains binaries used by the root user;

/srv: contains the data necessary for processes that provide services (web files for example, ...);

/tmp: contains temporary files used by processes that can be deleted (they are usually deleted on each restart);

/usr: contains applications for users. This directory is then divided into /bin, /lib...
 which have the same use as / but with user applications;

/var: contains log files.
