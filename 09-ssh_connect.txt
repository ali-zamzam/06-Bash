"""on vs code"""

- download remote ssh extension
- click on the ssh icon (like a computer screen)
- click on +
- in the window that opend we input (ssh ubuntu@IP of the machine)
- C:/Users/Ali/.ssh/config ( the path plus .ssh/config)
- in the config fil we see:

Host 52.30.172.188   # the ip
  HostName 52.30.172.188   # the ip
  IdentityFile ~/Desktop/your-key.pem   # the path of our ssh key file
  User ubuntu            # the name of the os

- if the ip of the machine changed we must modify the config file
- open the terminal to connect to the server


"""on windows"""

- open Cmd (invite de commands)
- download the ssh key
- if we have the ssh key on Downloads directory so we need to use:
- cd Downloads
- ssh -i"your-key.pem" ubuntu@X.X.X.X (X.X.X.X = IP of machine)



"""on ubuntu"""
- download the file which  contains the ssh key
- mkdir a directory (choose a name)
- cd (name of directory)
- touch key_file.txt
- paste the ssh key in the file
- $ ssh  to see the ssh key
- if we can't acess the file we use chmod 400 key_file.txt (400 gave us  the read rights r-- )
- ssh -i "key_file" ubuntu@X.X.X.X # replace X.X.X.X with your virtual machine's public IP address


"""or on gitbash"""

- pwd
- mkdir a directory (choose a name)
- cd (to the path of file ( desktop if we download it on desktop for example))
- ls | grep name of the file.pem
- chmod 400 (name of the file)
- ssh
- ssh -i "name of the file" ubuntu@X.X.X.X # replace X.X.X.X with your virtual machine's public IP address
